# Portfolio
Personal projects portfolio, showcasing skills in algorithms, a custom programming language, DFA, parser-lexer, sorting algorithms, Prim's algorithm, Java, C, memoization, OOP, dynamic programming, and web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP).

## 1. Algorithms and Data Structures
Projects in Java and C, covering (optimized for datasets up to 20 million records)  
*(Project for a University exam)*

   - **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementation of various sorting algorithms.
   - **Data Structures**: Including priority queues and graph structures.
   - **Graph Algorithms**: Prim's algorithm using a priority queue.
   - **Dynamic Programming**: Edit distance calculation with memoization.

## 2. Custom Programming Language
Implementation of a basic programming language for the JVM with a lexer and parser, as well as a simple project on DFA.  
*(Project for a University exam)*

  - **Lexer**: Takes a program and converts every character/phrase into a token for parsing.
  - **Parser**: Takes the tokens generated by the lexer and converts them into instructions for Jasmin.

It generates an `output.j` for Jasmin and reads from `scratch.lft`.

## 3. Website for Accommodation Facility
A web development project for an accommodation facility, featuring front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end functionality in PHP.
